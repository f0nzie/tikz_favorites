:Title: Mammography problem from 'Intro to Bayes'

The following was created in response to reading about "the mammography
problem," a commonly used example illustrating the use of Bayesian
Probability, on Eliezer Yudkowsky's page, "An Intuitive Explanation of
Bayes' Theorem." The visualization presents the problem as involving
"sieves" which behave differently depending on whether the individual
passing through has or does not have cancer, illustrating the split
probability created by the reliability of a mammography (chance of
producing true positives and false positives). The illustration was posted
on LessWrong.com, a site devoted to rationality, created by Yudkowsky.
